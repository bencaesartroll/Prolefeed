##First Story
If I may offer a Hot Take which rises to the level of an argument which may or may not result in a Think Piece, Jia: you are missing the key to this whole thing, because, basically, Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle.

You are ignoring the existence of the primary motivating force, the gravity (or the velocity, to extend the metaphor), the **raison d’être** for all of the writing you are discussing: the relationship between a thing (a website that gives news and information) and the person (the reader). You manage to go through a quite interesting disquisition on the inner workings of a machine while pretending that what the machine is actually doing (and supposed to be doing) has no effect on those inner workings. but that’s absurd—buzzfeed is what it is because of what it wants from its readers, and its behavior is

John Herrmann is wrong—the idea isn’t the end of all this, the reader is the end of all of this. buzzfeed either does or doesn’t owe its readers anything. it either does or doesn’t owe its advertisers anything. for the latter, that’s pretty simple—it’s contractual, and there are clauses that outline quite specifically what the value exchange is. for the reader, it’s the biggest question. does Gawker “owe” its readership anything?

buzzfeed is supposed to do two things, per its charter (not really a charter, obv): one, aggregate interested readers by writing posts about news and , and two, write pieces for its advertisers that are so keep that interest.

my answer is simple: i read gawker for intelligent writing and discourse about things that i care about, from a world view (lefty/snarky/self-aware) that i like. my problem with buzzfeed, and the reason i don’t read it, is because i have no idea why thIer machine exists in the first place for me—i just know why it exists for advertisers.

##Second Story
my answer is simple: i read gawker for intelligent writing and discourse about things that i care about, from a world view (lefty/snarky/self-aware) that i like. my problem with buzzfeed, and the reason i don’t read it, is because i have no idea why thIer machine exists in the first place for me—i just know why it exists for advertisers.

buzzfeed is supposed to do two things, per its charter (not really a charter, obv): one, aggregate interested readers by writing posts about news and , and two, write pieces for its advertisers that are so keep that interest.
